/**
 * Two City Scheduling
 * 
 * There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying
 * the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th
 * person to city B is costs[i][1].
 * 
 * Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N
 * people arrive in each city.
 * 
 * Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
 * 
 * Output: 110
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10. The second person goes to
 * city A for a cost of 30. The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
 * The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
 * 
 * The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people
 * interviewing in each city.
